## Background

**Proptech**, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. The project assumes that youâ€™re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

Your job is to use your data visualisation skills, including aggregation, interactive visualisations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.
